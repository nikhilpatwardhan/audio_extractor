Extract audio snippets from long bird sound recordings and tag them with metadata

### Background
Sometimes I record very long sessions of audio (few hours) by keeping the audio recorder device outdoors
unattended in an area where birds might vocalize. At the end of this session I get a few massive (gigabytes)
audio files. It is tedious to then peruse these files for loud and clear recordings, and then
save just those sections individually with metadata like bird name, location, date, copyright, etc. entered manually.

### This tool
I plan to still examine the raw audio file manually, but would like to tag sections of it with bird names,
and let this tool extract those portions, save them in high quality wav format, and tag the relevant metadata
into those snippet files. The tool could also write a smaller sharable versions of the same files.
